# GoalPilot Coding Conventions

**Status:** Mandatory for humans and Codex<br>
**Version:** 1.0<br>
**Baseline date:** 2026-08-23

These rules are part of the implementation contract. A pull request is incomplete when it violates this document, even if the code appears to work.

## 1. Operating rules for Codex

Before editing code, Codex must:

1. Read `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/STACK.md`, `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, and the active section of
   `docs/TASKS.md`.
2. Inspect the repository, current branch, existing tests, and current diff.
3. Confirm the task's prerequisites are complete.
4. Identify the smallest vertical slice that satisfies the active task.
5. Run the current relevant baseline checks before making changes.

During implementation, Codex must:

- work on one task group at a time;
- remain inside the paths assigned by the task;
- make ordinary engineering decisions without asking for permission when these documents resolve them;
- stop and record a decision when a proposed change conflicts with product policy, security boundaries, real-money restrictions, or the approved stack;
- add or update tests with every behavior change;
- update documentation in the same change when contracts or operations change;
- preserve a runnable repository;
- fix root causes rather than suppressing errors;
- never reduce a quality threshold to get a passing result;
- never claim that a command passed unless it was executed successfully.

Codex must not:

- add a real financial provider;
- add Plaid, bank credentials, money movement, custody, trading, lending, or staking;
- add another framework or database;
- change exact package versions without updating `STACK.md` and recording the reason;
- place secrets in source, tests, screenshots, examples, logs, or documentation;
- mark a task complete before its stated evidence exists;
- combine unrelated refactors with a feature task;
- silently change calculation or eligibility policy;
- create a workaround when a direct permanent fix is available.

## 2. Language and module rules

- All application and infrastructure code is TypeScript.
- JavaScript is allowed only in tool-generated configuration when TypeScript is unsupported.
- Use ESM imports and exports.
- Use named exports by default.
- Default exports are allowed only when a framework convention requires them.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- Do not use CommonJS `require` in application code.
- Do not use barrel files across domain boundaries. A package may have one intentional public `index.ts` API.
- Internal files may not be imported through deep paths from another package.
- Circular dependencies are prohibited.

## 3. Repository boundaries

### 3.1 Allowed dependency direction

```text
apps/web
  → packages/ui
  → packages/contracts

apps/api
  → packages/auth
  → packages/data-access
  → packages/provider-ports
  → packages/provider-simulators
  → packages/contracts
  → packages/domain
  → packages/observability

packages/domain
  → packages/contracts

packages/provider-simulators
  → packages/provider-ports
  → packages/contracts
  → packages/domain

packages/data-access
  → packages/contracts
  → packages/domain

future M19–M22 infra/cdk (not present in the current repository)
  → no application package except build artifact entry points
```

### 3.2 Prohibited dependencies

`packages/domain` must not import:

- React;
- Fastify;
- Drizzle;
- AWS SDKs;
- Cognito;
- environment variables;
- databases;
- file systems;
- HTTP clients;
- provider adapters;
- AI libraries.

`packages/contracts` must not import application packages.

`apps/web` must not import database, AWS, provider, or backend implementation packages.

`packages/provider-ports` contains interfaces and provider-neutral value types only. Provider-specific SDK types may not cross this boundary.

## 4. Naming conventions

### Files and folders

| Item                      | Convention                             | Example                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| folders                   | kebab-case                             | `recommendation-engine`               |
| ordinary TypeScript files | kebab-case                             | `calculate-required-contribution.ts`  |
| React components          | PascalCase file                        | `GoalProgressCard.tsx`                |
| tests                     | subject plus `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` | `goal-policy.test.ts`                 |
| integration tests         | `.integration.test.ts`                 | `goal-repository.integration.test.ts` |
| Playwright tests          | `.spec.ts`                             | `goal-builder.spec.ts`                |
| migrations                | timestamp plus description             | `202608230001_create_goals.sql`       |

### TypeScript identifiers

| Item                        | Convention                    | Example                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| variables and functions     | camelCase                     | `calculateEndingBalance`      |
| classes and types           | PascalCase                    | `GoalProjection`              |
| interfaces                  | PascalCase, no `I` prefix     | `RateProvider`                |
| constants                   | camelCase unless truly global | `maxGoalAmountCents`          |
| environment keys            | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE          | `DATABASE_URL`                |
| stable error codes          | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE          | `GOAL_NOT_FOUND`              |
| database tables and columns | snake_case                    | `vehicle_assumption_versions` |
| route parameters            | camelCase                     | `goalId`                      |
| security audit event names  | past-tense dot notation       | `goal.plan_activated`         |
| product event names         | closed snake_case enum        | `plan_archived`               |

Avoid vague names such as `data`, `item`, `thing`, `manager`, `helper`, `utils`, `common`, or `misc` unless the scope makes the meaning unambiguous.

## 5. TypeScript standards

The compiler runs in strict mode with the options in `STACK.md`.

Mandatory rules:

- `any` is prohibited. Use `unknown` and narrow it.
- Type assertions are exceptional and must be justified by a nearby comment or boundary validator.
- Non-null assertions are prohibited outside tests unless a preceding invariant check makes the value logically certain.
- Use discriminated unions for finite states.
- Use exhaustive `switch` statements with an `assertNever` function.
- Prefer immutable values and `readonly` fields.
- Avoid mutable module-level state.
- Prefer pure functions for domain calculations.
- Return a new object instead of mutating an input.
- Public functions require explicit parameter and return types.
- Do not use numeric enums. Use string-literal unions or `as const` maps.
- Do not use `Date` as an implicit global clock inside domain logic. Pass `asOfDate` explicitly.
- Validate all values crossing process, HTTP, database, provider, or configuration boundaries.

Example state type:

```ts
type GoalStatus = 'draft' | 'active' | 'paused' | 'purchase_ready' | 'completed' | 'archived';
```

## 6. Money, rates, dates, and financial calculations

### Money

- Store and transport USD money as integer cents.
- Database type is `bigint`.
- API JSON uses a string for values that may exceed safe JavaScript integer range, otherwise a contract-approved integer. Use one representation consistently.
- Domain code uses a branded `MoneyCents` type.
- Never store money as `float`, `double precision`, or a JavaScript decimal number with fractional cents.
- Formatting belongs at the presentation boundary.

### Rates

- Store simple rates in integer basis points when possible.
- Use `decimal.js` only for exact division, compounding, or fractional-rate calculations.
- Configure one explicit precision and rounding mode in the domain package.
- Convert to cents only at documented posting boundaries.
- Never use an advertised APY to infer a guaranteed outcome.

### Dates

- Calendar target dates use `YYYY-MM-DD` and have no timezone.
- Events and audit times use UTC `timestamptz`.
- The domain receives an explicit processing date.
- Weekly and biweekly schedules preserve the selected weekday.
- Monthly schedules define month-end behavior in tests.
- Leap years, daylight-saving transitions, short months, and target-date boundaries require tests.

### Calculation behavior

- Equal normalized input, assumptions, and processing date must yield equal output.
- Calculation functions return both result and trace metadata.
- Every policy rejection uses a stable code and human-readable message mapping.
- The zero-interest baseline is calculated before any vehicle result.
- Interest is separated from contributed principal in every result.
- When a goal is behind, the engine recommends contribution, deadline, or target changes before any future increase in risk.

## 7. Validation and contracts

- Zod schemas are the runtime source of truth for HTTP and shared contracts.
- Input and output schemas are separate when server-generated fields differ.
- Do not call `.passthrough()` on financial or authentication schemas.
- Reject unknown fields on write endpoints.
- Normalize strings, dates, money, and enums once at the boundary.
- Domain functions receive validated normalized types, not raw HTTP values.
- OpenAPI must be generated from or tested against the same route schemas.
- Every data-bearing 2xx operation declares a strict response schema; 204 remains bodyless.
- Schema changes require API tests and, where applicable, migration notes.

## 8. Backend layering

Each backend feature follows:

```text
route
→ application service/use case
→ domain policy or calculation
→ repository/provider port
→ adapter
```

### Route handlers

Route handlers may:

- read authenticated context;
- validate route parameters, query, headers, and body;
- invoke one application use case;
- map success to an HTTP response;
- allow centralized error mapping to handle failures.

Route handlers may not:

- contain financial calculations;
- compose SQL;
- call Drizzle directly;
- trust ownership fields from the request;
- catch and discard errors;
- return database records directly.

### Application services

Application services coordinate a use case and transaction. They enforce authorization before a protected mutation and call domain functions for business decisions.

### Repositories

- Every protected repository method requires the authenticated internal user ID.
- Ownership belongs in the SQL predicate, not only in application memory.
- Return `null` when an owned record does not exist.
- Cross-user and missing records map to the same `404` behavior.
- Repositories return domain or persistence DTOs, never HTTP responses.
- Queries must select only required columns.

## 9. Database conventions

- All schema changes use committed SQL migrations.
- An applied migration file is immutable. Add a later lexical migration; the runner rejects a
  checksum change to an applied filename.
- Never use schema push in shared or deployed environments.
- Migrations are forward-safe and reviewed.
- Destructive migrations require an expand, migrate, contract sequence.
- Foreign keys and check constraints enforce important invariants.
- Use unique constraints for idempotency and schedule occurrence IDs.
- `schedule_occurrences` records processed due dates only. Store the schedule anchor and next due
  date on plan/account state; do not pre-populate projected future occurrences.
- Use transactions for multi-record state changes.
- Keep transaction callbacks short and free of network calls.
- Never call AWS, OAuth, or another provider inside a database transaction.
- Story advance claims one per-user clock-row lease with a ULID token and ten-minute expiry.
  Existing-goal update, draft/legacy activation, lifecycle/archive, manual contribution,
  scenario/recovery apply, and seeded reset reject an active lease; expired claims may be replaced,
  only the current token may release, and ownership loss fails closed. Do not claim this guard for
  draft CRUD, stateless previews, Timing work, or privacy deletion.
- Interest processing sums/counts ledger rows only through its processing date and compares that
  revision plus locked accrual, goal, and plan state before posting. On conflict, reload and
  recalculate from the same date under a bounded three-conflict policy.
- A per-user application clock behind persisted account/ledger dates exposes the greatest pending
  financial date to the Story loop for idempotent crash recovery. Never fold future-effective rows
  into an earlier balance, plan, activity, or interest result.
- Serialize reversal-source validation by locking the owned simulated account.
- Use indexes based on actual query patterns.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` are UTC timestamps.
- Append-only tables do not expose update methods.
- Seed data is deterministic and versioned.

## 10. Authentication, authorization, and sessions

- Current local PX uses `LocalAuthProvider`; GoalPilot authenticates with a salted scrypt password
  hash and authorizes every operation from an opaque hashed server-side session. Cognito/OAuth is
  future M19–M22 only.
- Never accept `userId`, `ownerId`, or a future external identity subject from a write body.
- The local session cookie is `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`; the CSRF cookie is intentionally
  browser-readable and `SameSite=Lax`. Both use path `/`. `Secure=false` is allowed only for the
  loopback-HTTP local/test process, which rejects staging/production. A future HTTPS adapter must
  use `Secure=true`.
- Session identifiers are cryptographically random and stored only as hashes.
- Future OAuth state, nonce, and PKCE transactions are single-use and expire quickly.
- Future refresh-token material is encrypted at rest and never logged.
- State-changing browser requests require CSRF validation and Origin checking.
- Authorization failure for a resource identifier returns 404 unless the endpoint is explicitly administrative.
- Administrative authorization is denied by default.

Missing/foreign resources and feature-flagged routes that are not registered return
indistinguishable 404s. Use 403 only for a non-resource policy denial, including CSRF/Origin failure
or demo advance by an authenticated user without the persisted seeded-fixture capability. A reset
that does not match the caller's owned marked fixture remains 404.

## 11. Error handling

Define one error hierarchy:

```ts
abstract class AppError extends Error {
  abstract readonly code: ErrorCode;
  abstract readonly httpStatus: number;
  readonly safeDetails?: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>;
}
```

Approved categories:

- `ValidationError` - 400;
- `AuthenticationRequiredError` - 401;
- `ForbiddenOperationError` - 403 only for non-resource policy denials;
- `ResourceNotFoundError` - 404;
- `ConflictError` - 409;
- `RateLimitError` - 429;
- `ExternalDependencyError` - 502 or 503;
- `InvariantViolationError` - 500, never exposes details;
- `ConfigurationError` - startup failure.

Rules:

- Do not throw raw strings.
- Do not leak stack traces, SQL, tokens, internal IDs, configuration, or dependency messages to clients.
- Unexpected errors receive a correlation ID and generic `INTERNAL_ERROR` response.
- User-correctable errors provide safe field-level guidance.
- Catch an error only when adding context, translating it, retrying under a bounded policy, or performing required cleanup.
- Never write `catch {}`.

API error shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "GOAL_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested goal was not found.",
    "requestId": "01K...",
    "fieldErrors": null
  }
}
```

## 12. Idempotency

State-changing operations identified in `PRD.md` require an `Idempotency-Key` header.

Rules:

- Scope the key to authenticated user plus operation.
- Hash the normalized request.
- Replay the stored successful response for the same key and request hash.
- Return 409 when the same key is reused with a different request.
- The browser retains one key for the same mutation payload through a transport or ambiguous
  failure, creates a new key when the payload changes, and clears the retained key only after
  success. Story advance scopes retained keys by selected milestone; reset scopes one to its
  confirmation payload.
- Use a unique database constraint, not an in-memory check.
- Application work that cannot atomically persist its response first uses
  `application_command_claims`. A possibly committed/indeterminate claim fails closed; only a caller
  that proves no work committed may explicitly mark it retryable. Completion moves the response to
  `idempotency_records` and removes the claim.
- Do not conflate an `application_command_claims` response-persistence claim with either the
  ten-minute owner financial-run lease stored on `user_application_clocks` or the bounded
  provider-work generation lease stored on a `price_check_runs` row.
- Scheduled simulation events use deterministic occurrence IDs.
- Never delete idempotency records before their documented expiration.

## 13. Logging and observability

Use structured Pino logs.

Every request log may include:

- timestamp;
- level;
- service;
- environment;
- request ID;
- route template;
- method;
- response status;
- duration;
- anonymous internal user reference only when required;
- stable error code.

Never log:

- authorization headers;
- cookies;
- OAuth codes;
- access, ID, or refresh tokens;
- PKCE verifiers;
- CSRF tokens;
- passwords or MFA codes;
- email addresses in routine logs;
- goal names or notes;
- complete request or response bodies;
- database URLs;
- secrets;
- dollar amounts unless aggregated and expressly approved.

All redaction is tested. `console.log` is prohibited in application code.

## 14. API conventions

- Product-resource routes use `/api/v1`; `/health/*` and `/auth/*` are intentional unversioned
  operational/identity exceptions.
- Resource paths use plural nouns.
- Actions use explicit subresources only when normal CRUD is insufficient.
- JSON uses camelCase.
- HTTP status codes are intentional and tested.
- Create returns 201 plus canonical representation.
- Delete or archive returns 204 when no body is needed.
- Long-running asynchronous work returns 202 with a status URL. The current product-event route is
  an immediate validated telemetry acknowledgement and returns only `{ accepted: true }`.
- Add cursor-based pagination when a collection is no longer bounded for the local release; current
  owner-scoped list routes are unpaginated.
- Dates are ISO strings.
- Responses are DTOs, not persistence objects.
- Health and readiness endpoints expose no secrets or dependency credentials.
- Swagger UI is available only in the current loopback-only local/test process; any future hosted
  environment must disable or protect it.

## 15. React conventions

### Components

- Prefer small feature components with clear inputs.
- A component does not fetch data and render a large page unless it is a route-level container.
- Shared primitive components live in `packages/ui`.
- Feature components remain with the feature.
- Do not edit generated shadcn source blindly. Adapt it to GoalPilot conventions and test it.
- Use semantic HTML before ARIA.
- Do not create generic wrappers that only rename an HTML element.

### State

- Server state uses TanStack Query.
- Form state uses React Hook Form plus Zod.
- URL state uses React Router search parameters where shareable.
- Local UI state uses React state.
- Do not add Redux, Zustand, MobX, or another global store without an ADR.
- Derived values are computed, not duplicated in state.
- Financial calculations are never reproduced in the browser. Preview numbers come from the API.

### Data fetching

- All requests pass through one typed API client.
- Query keys are feature-owned factories.
- Mutations invalidate or update the narrowest correct cache.
- Abort requests on navigation where appropriate.
- Display loading, error, empty, stale, and success states.
- Never translate a failed capability, account, health, activity, or collection query into a
  disabled, not-activated, or empty state. Keep the error retryable.
- Never hide an API error only in the browser console.

### Forms

- Every field has a visible label.
- Helper text precedes errors in reading order.
- On submission failure, focus the error summary or first invalid field.
- Buttons state the action, such as `Create goal`, not `Submit`.
- Destructive actions require an explicit confirmation dialog.
- Currency input is parsed to cents at the boundary; do not store formatted strings as domain values.

## 16. Accessibility and design

- Target WCAG 2.2 AA for critical flows.
- All functionality is keyboard operable.
- Focus indicators are always visible.
- Modal focus is trapped and restored.
- Text contrast meets AA.
- Color is never the sole meaning carrier.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Charts have a table or textual summary.
- Icons used as controls have accessible names.
- Decorative icons are hidden from assistive technology.
- Touch targets are at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels where practical.
- Test at 360, 768, 1024, and 1440 pixel widths.
- Do not use animation to delay access to financial results.

## 17. CSS and visual system

- Use design tokens rather than arbitrary repeated colors.
- Primary brand starts from British racing green, but contrast determines actual foreground pairings.
- Do not place low-contrast green text on dark green.
- Use muted gold only as an accent, never the sole indicator of warning or success.
- Avoid gradients unless they add hierarchy and remain subtle.
- Avoid excessive glassmorphism, neon glow, and dashboard clutter.
- Use one chart accent palette defined in tokens.
- Tailwind arbitrary values are allowed only when a token is genuinely inappropriate.
- Use the `cn` helper for class composition.
- No inline style objects except calculated SVG/chart geometry or unavoidable third-party integration.

## 18. Testing conventions

### Test pyramid

1. Pure unit tests for domain functions.
2. Property and golden tests for calculations.
3. PostgreSQL integration tests for repositories and migrations.
4. Fastify injection tests for API behavior.
5. React behavior tests for components.
6. Playwright tests for critical journeys.
7. Production-built loopback local/demo smoke tests.
8. Future M19–M22 only: CDK assertions/synthesis and deployed smoke tests.

### Rules

- Test behavior, not private implementation.
- Every defect receives a regression test.
- A test name states the expected behavior.
- Tests use deterministic clocks, assumptions, and identifiers.
- No real network calls in unit or integration tests.
- Fixtures contain synthetic data only.
- Do not use snapshots for financial results or complex business behavior.
- Avoid brittle selectors; Playwright uses roles, labels, and visible names.
- Do not use arbitrary sleeps. Wait for observable conditions.
- Flaky tests are defects and may not be retried indefinitely.

### Minimum quality expectations

The current numeric configuration is exact:

- Domain: lines, branches, functions, and statements each at least 90 percent, plus every
  documented invariant.
- API: lines and statements at least 85 percent and functions at least 90 percent; no branch floor
  is currently configured.
- Data access: lines and statements at least 85 percent and functions at least 90 percent; no
  branch floor is currently configured.
- Explicit exclusions are `**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`, `apps/api/src/server.ts`, and
  `packages/data-access/src/schema.ts`. Do not add an exclusion or lower a floor merely to pass.
- Every protected resource: positive and cross-user negative test.
- Every state transition: valid and invalid transition test.
- Every critical web journey: Playwright coverage.
- Every financial number displayed in a critical flow: API-to-UI consistency assertion.
- Current Playwright release scope is Journeys A–E as defined in `TESTING.md`; it includes stable
  Chrome, ownership/capability semantics, telemetry shape, Axe, responsive overflow, reduced
  motion, and reset-dialog keyboard/focus behavior in the states explicitly named there.

## 19. Security conventions

- Threat model all new trust boundaries.
- Future M19–M22: apply least privilege to IAM.
- Future M19–M22: use GitHub OIDC, never static AWS keys.
- Future M19–M22: use SSM parameters or deployment secret stores, never committed configuration.
- Validate environment variables at startup and fail closed.
- Use a fixed CORS allowlist.
- Add CSP and other security headers.
- Current local mode uses in-process rate limiting. Future M19–M22 API Gateway throttling becomes
  authoritative.
- Do not trust internet headers; future API Gateway/CloudFront must overwrite any header used as a
  security boundary.
- Protect against IDOR, injection, XSS, CSRF, open redirects, SSRF, unsafe deserialization, and resource exhaustion.
- There are no arbitrary URL-fetch features in the MVP.
- No user-uploaded files in the MVP.
- Dependency additions require license and security review.
- Critical or high production dependency vulnerabilities block release unless a written exception is approved.

## 20. Configuration conventions

- Parse environment configuration once at startup.
- Export a typed immutable configuration object.
- No direct `process.env` reads outside the configuration module.
- Separate local, test, staging, and production configuration.
- Never default to insecure production behavior.
- `AUTH_MODE=local` is the only shipped adapter. `AUTH_MODE=external` is rejected, and the current
  application refuses staging/production startup entirely.
- Every external resource name includes project and environment.
- Feature flags default off.

## 21. Git and pull request conventions

Branch names:

```text
feat/gp-###-short-description
fix/gp-###-short-description
chore/gp-###-short-description
```

Commit subjects use imperative Conventional Commits:

```text
feat(goals): add simulated contribution ledger
fix(auth): reject reused OAuth state
chore(ci): generate CycloneDX SBOM
```

Pull requests must include:

- task IDs;
- product outcome;
- files and contracts changed;
- exact tests executed;
- screenshots for visual changes;
- accessibility impact;
- security and privacy impact;
- database migration impact;
- infrastructure and cost impact;
- rollback behavior;
- known limitations.

No direct pushes to `main`. One non-author review and all required checks are mandatory.

## 22. Documentation conventions

- Documentation describes current behavior, not aspiration, unless labeled future.
- Every command must be copyable.
- Do not claim a deployment or test exists without evidence.
- Update OpenAPI with route changes.
- Update the ERD with schema changes.
- Update `TASKS.md` only after exit checks pass.
- Use plain factual language.
- Avoid marketing claims in implementation documentation.
- Record an ADR for changes to architecture, financial policy, authentication, persistence, or cloud topology.

## 23. Definition of done for any task

A task is complete only when:

1. Acceptance criteria are satisfied.
2. Code follows module boundaries.
3. Relevant tests were added and pass.
4. Strict type checking passes.
5. Lint and formatting pass with no warnings.
6. Documentation and contracts are current.
7. Security and privacy implications were reviewed.
8. No unrelated diff remains.
9. Evidence is recorded in the pull request or task section.
10. The non-author review is complete.

An implementation that merely works on the author's machine is not done.

## 24. Product-experience conventions

- Customer copy says **Simulated Goal Plan**. Internal persistence names may remain stable.
- The zero-interest safe contribution is revealed before budget fit and remains the primary
  commitment. React never calculates it.
- Interest is always illustrative cushion; it cannot lower the displayed commitment or override an
  access/maturity failure.
- Lifecycle and `PlanHealth` are distinct typed values. Health follows ADR 0003 precedence and uses
  explanation codes, never an opaque score.
- Scenario types make zero or multiple changes unrepresentable. Preview is stateless; apply reloads
  the base snapshot and creates immutable history.
- Recovery is limited to contribution, deadline, and target; no vehicle/risk/debt escalation.
- Partial drafts do not weaken complete financial aggregates. They are owner-scoped, strict,
  optimistic-versioned, and atomically promoted. Promotion stores a schedule anchor/next date; it
  does not create projected future `schedule_occurrences`.
- Consumer controlled-clock operations are authenticated, per-user, milestone-only, and seeded
  reset is capability-based. Never infer reset authority from email or UI state. HTTP reset
  requires `RESET_SEEDED_STORY_DEMO` and the expected goal version.
- Story advance owns one bounded clock-row financial-run lease. Current-token release, active-run
  mutation denial, processing-date financial revisions, bounded interest reload, and pending-date
  crash recovery are required; the browser must present a concurrent run as a retryable conflict.
- Feature flags default off, are reported by the server, and are enforced in the API. Hidden UI is
  not an authorization control.
- Product telemetry uses one schema per allowlisted event and fixed categorical columns. No money,
  entered text, URL, email, resource/session/request/CSRF identifiers, secrets, or free metadata.
  Timing routine outcomes are limited to `purchase_timing_check_completed`,
  `purchase_timing_check_failed`, `purchase_timing_check_replayed`, and
  `purchase_timing_check_no_due`. Observing another unexpired Timing worker returns `in_progress`
  and emits no outcome event.
- Timing provider work owns one ten-minute generation token on the unique policy/application-date
  run. Active work is not duplicated; expired work advances the same row by one attempt, no more
  than three attempts are permitted, and only the matching current generation may complete or
  fail. Terminal rows clear the worker token and expiry. A superseded worker reports
  `in_progress`, not a failure; an all-transient summary emits no outcome event.
- Historical price observations and assessments are immutable and versioned. Timing language is
  descriptive and non-predictive; readiness always gates favorable-price copy. Retained Timing
  UI shows assessment-time lifecycle/target and marks the assessment stale when the current item
  target differs.
- Completed and archived workspaces keep decision, history, activity, and Timing reads while
  removing What-If, recovery, advance, contribution, pause, resume, and completion controls. A
  completed goal may retain only the explicit archive action; an archived goal has no mutation
  controls.
- Privacy export uses the closed `goalpilot-user-data-export-v2` owner-filtered shape. Never add
  password/session/CSRF material, command/idempotency internals (including Timing worker
  token/expiry fields), audits, or product events to it. Every nested export record remains strict.
  Account deletion cascades owned product rows and scrubs/pseudonymizes retained audits.
- Product UI tests cover first use, loading, empty, validation, dependency/network failure, stale
  response, conflict, disabled capability, and relevant domain states, including focus recovery.
- Release docs distinguish specification, executed automated evidence, and real human-validation
  evidence. Never turn a fixture, event count, plan, or blank results template into a validation
  claim.
- Performance source thresholds are regression ceilings, not evidence. Record the exact successful
  command and measured result, retain prior failures when relevant, and do not translate a local
  ceiling into a production SLO.
