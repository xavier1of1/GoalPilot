# GoalPilot MVP Technology Stack

**Status:** Approved stack baseline for Codex  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Pinned on:** 2026-08-23  
**Decision goal:** Lowest practical MVP cost while preserving security, full-stack depth, AWS experience, PostgreSQL portability, and a clean path to real financial-provider integrations.

> **Current authority:** M00–M18 and PX00–PX10 are the active local release. Every AWS service and
> package in this document remains future M19–M22 work unless a section explicitly says current.

## 1. Architecture decision

GoalPilot will use a TypeScript monorepo containing a React single-page application, a Fastify modular API, a pure calculation domain, PostgreSQL persistence, AWS serverless hosting, and provider ports with simulation adapters.

### 1.1 Current local-first release topology

The local MVP is the only active release target. It runs without AWS credentials or services:

```text
Browser at http://localhost:5173
  -> React + Vite
  -> Fastify at http://localhost:3000
  -> PostgreSQL 17 at localhost:5432
```

Local authentication uses opaque, hashed, server-side sessions behind `AuthProvider`. Financial
activity is implemented only by deterministic simulation adapters. `AUTH_MODE=local` and
`FINANCIAL_PROVIDER_MODE=simulated` are rejected when `ENVIRONMENT` is not `local` or `test`.
The AWS topology below is a future adaptation and is not built or deployed before the local release
gate in `TASKS.md` passes.

```text
Browser
  → CloudFront
     → private S3 origin for React assets
     → /api and /auth to API Gateway HTTP API
        → Lambda running Fastify
           → Neon PostgreSQL
           → Cognito OAuth endpoints
           → scheduled simulation handler
```

Scheduled demo activity:

```text
EventBridge Scheduler
  → simulation Lambda handler
     → PostgreSQL ledger and schedule records
```

This replaces the earlier fixed-cost beta topology of ECS Fargate, an Application Load Balancer, NAT Gateway, WAF, and RDS. Fastify remains transport-portable so the API can move to ECS later without rewriting routes or domain code.

## 2. Cost posture

### Target at MVP volume

| Item                                    |                                 MVP target | Notes                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| React hosting through S3 and CloudFront |                                $0–$2/month | Usually within low-traffic/free allowances; usage dependent.                         |
| API Gateway HTTP API and Lambda         |                                $0–$2/month | Scales to zero; usage and free-tier status vary by account.                          |
| Cognito                                 |                    $0 at small test volume | Confirm current MAU pricing before public release.                                   |
| EventBridge Scheduler                   |                           Approximately $0 | One low-frequency schedule.                                                          |
| CloudWatch                              |                                $0–$2/month | Structured, low-volume logs with short retention.                                    |
| SSM Parameter Store standard parameters |                                  $0 target | Avoid Secrets Manager's per-secret fixed charge for MVP.                             |
| Neon PostgreSQL                         |                                  $0 target | Free plan; storage, compute, sleep, backup, and connection limits must be monitored. |
| GitHub Actions                          |                                  $0 target | Private-repository allowances depend on the account plan.                            |
| Domain                                  | Optional, roughly annual registration cost | CloudFront URL works before a domain is purchased.                                   |
| **Expected tiny-MVP infrastructure**    |  **Approximately $0–$6/month plus domain** | A target, not a guarantee. Set AWS budgets before deployment.                        |

Cost can increase because of traffic, logs, database usage, free-tier expiration, custom domains, build minutes, data transfer, or provider-plan changes. Codex must not describe the MVP as permanently free.

## 3. Runtime and package management

| Tool           |             Exact baseline | Decision                                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js        |              `24.19.0` LTS | Local, CI, Lambda runtime family and Dev Container.                              |
| pnpm           |                  `11.22.0` | Workspace management and deterministic lockfile.                                 |
| TypeScript     |                    `6.0.3` | Chosen instead of the newer TypeScript 7 line for broader tooling compatibility. |
| Module format  |                        ESM | `"type": "module"` in all packages.                                              |
| Package policy |      Exact direct versions | Do not use `^`, `~`, `latest`, or wildcard versions.                             |
| Lockfile       | `pnpm-lock.yaml` committed | CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.                                        |

Before writing application code, Codex must execute a compatibility spike that installs this exact set, runs type checking, builds the web/API/infra packages, and records any necessary correction in `STACK.md`. It may not silently substitute a package.

| `@neondatabase/serverless` |       `1.1.0` | Serverless PostgreSQL driver.                                                                  |

The API has two entry points:

- ordinary local Node server;
- AWS Lambda handler wrapping the same Fastify instance.

Business logic must not import Lambda event types.

## 7. Database

| Choice           | Baseline                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Engine           | PostgreSQL major version 17                                                              |
| Development      | Docker image `postgres:17-alpine`; minor patches float within major for security updates |
| Hosted MVP       | Neon serverless PostgreSQL free plan                                                     |
| Query layer      | Parameterized `postgres` `3.4.9` tagged templates                                        |
| Migration tool   | Repository-owned ordered SQL runner                                                      |
| Migration format | Reviewed SQL committed to `packages/data-access/migrations`                              |
| Identifier       | ULID text with check constraints or PostgreSQL UUID where a provider requires UUID       |
| Money            | `bigint` cents, never PostgreSQL floating point                                          |
| Rates            | integer basis points where possible; exact numeric/decimal for fractional calculations   |
| Time             | `timestamptz` in UTC                                                                     |
| Calendar dates   | PostgreSQL `date`                                                                        |

Why Neon:

- zero-idle-cost target for the MVP;
- PostgreSQL-compatible relational model;
- serverless driver suitable for Lambda;
- avoids an always-on RDS instance before product validation.

Tradeoffs:

- free plans can sleep, throttle, cap storage, or change;
- cold database compute can add latency;
- cross-provider network latency exists;
- production financial integrations may require a paid plan, stronger retention, private networking, or migration to RDS/Aurora.

Portability requirements:

- no Neon-specific SQL in domain repositories unless isolated;
- all schema changes are normal PostgreSQL migrations;
- backups and data export are documented;
- migration to RDS must not require a domain rewrite.

Compatibility note (2026-08-23): the originally pinned Drizzle `0.45.2` declaration files do not
pass the approved TypeScript `6.0.3` configuration with `skipLibCheck=false`, including errors in
optional non-PostgreSQL drivers. The local MVP therefore uses the conventions-approved explicit
parameterized-query option and reviewed SQL migrations instead of weakening type checking.

### Product-experience persistence additions

PX uses the same PostgreSQL database and ordered SQL runner. It adds forward-only migrations for
owner-scoped drafts, immutable plan provenance, per-user controlled clocks, seeded-fixture
capability, constrained product events, and the five Purchase Timing Lab concepts. JSON is allowed
only for a strict, versioned partial-draft payload; telemetry has fixed columns and no arbitrary
metadata. Composite owner keys, integer cents, date checks, unique replay keys, and immutable/
append-only triggers remain mandatory.

The Timing Lab adds no database, queue, cache, scraper, retailer client, or statistical/AI package.
Its small exact algorithm uses TypeScript integer/Decimal primitives and deterministic committed
fixtures behind `HistoricalPriceProvider`.

## 8. Authentication and session design

Use Amazon Cognito User Pools with the hosted authorization endpoint, authorization-code flow, and PKCE.

Recommended web flow:

```text
Browser requests /auth/login
→ API creates state, nonce and PKCE transaction
→ browser redirects to Cognito
→ Cognito redirects to /auth/callback
→ API exchanges code server-side
→ API validates tokens
→ API stores encrypted refresh-token/session material in PostgreSQL
→ browser receives opaque HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax session cookie
```

Requirements:

- refresh tokens never enter JavaScript-accessible storage;
- session IDs are random and stored as hashes;
- state-changing routes require CSRF protection and Origin validation;
- sessions have absolute and idle expiration;
- sign-out revokes or invalidates session state;
- TOTP MFA is supported in infrastructure;
- local development uses a clearly isolated test-auth adapter only when `AUTH_MODE=development` and deployment synthesis rejects that mode.

## 9. Calculation implementation

`packages/domain` is pure TypeScript and may depend only on:

- `decimal.js`;
- selected `date-fns` pure helpers, wrapped behind local date utilities;
- `zod` for boundary schemas.

It may not import:

- Fastify;
- React;
- Drizzle;
- AWS SDKs;
- environment variables;
- databases;
- provider SDKs;
- AI libraries.

Money is represented as branded integer cents. Rate calculations use explicit conventions and rounding modes. Every calculation takes an `asOfDate` and assumption version; it never reads the system clock internally.

### Explicitly omitted from MVP

- ECS Fargate;
- Application Load Balancer;
- NAT Gateway;
- RDS or Aurora;
- ElastiCache or Redis;
- OpenSearch;
- DynamoDB;
- RDS Proxy;
- Step Functions;
- paid VPC interface endpoints;
- Bedrock;
- WAF;
- multi-region deployment.

WAF becomes mandatory before broad public access or any real financial-provider integration. It is deferred only to avoid a fixed cost during the simulation MVP.

## 11. Infrastructure as code

| Package       | Exact version |
| ------------- | ------------: |
| `aws-cdk-lib` |     `2.266.0` |
| `constructs`  |      `10.8.0` |
| CDK CLI       |    `2.1135.1` |
| `esbuild`     |      `0.28.2` |

CDK stacks:

1. `GoalPilotEdgeStack`
   - S3, CloudFront, optional ACM integration and security headers.
2. `GoalPilotIdentityStack`
   - Cognito pool, clients and hosted-domain configuration.
3. `GoalPilotApiStack`
   - HTTP API, Lambda functions, schedules, log groups, alarms, parameters and permissions.
4. `GoalPilotDeploymentStack` or deployment construct
   - optional GitHub OIDC role and artifact permissions.

Stateful resources receive explicit retention and removal policies. Development and production configurations are separate. Production deletion protection is enabled where supported.

## 12. Testing stack

| Package                     | Exact version | Purpose                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------: | ----------------------------------- |
| `vitest`                    |      `4.1.10` | Unit and integration test runner.   |
| `@playwright/test`          |      `1.62.1` | Browser end-to-end testing.         |
| `@testing-library/react`    |      `16.3.0` | React behavior tests.               |
| `@testing-library/jest-dom` |       `6.9.1` | Accessible DOM assertions.          |
| `jsdom`                     |      `27.0.1` | Component-test browser environment. |
| `@axe-core/playwright`      |      `4.10.2` | Automated accessibility checks.     |

Test environments:

- pure unit tests without services;
- PostgreSQL integration tests using Docker;
- API tests through Fastify `inject`;
- browser tests against local web/API;
- CDK assertion and synthesis tests;
- deployed smoke tests against a nonproduction URL.

Do not mock the calculation engine in API integration tests. Do not mock the API in the critical end-to-end journey.

## 13. Developer tooling

Baseline direct development dependencies:

| Package             | Exact version |
| ------------------- | ------------: |
| `eslint`            |      `10.8.1` |
| `@eslint/js`        |      `10.0.1` |
| `typescript-eslint` |      `8.67.0` |
| `prettier`          |       `3.6.2` |
| `tsx`               |     `4.23.12` |
| `shadcn`            |      `4.19.0` |

Repository tooling:

- EditorConfig;
- ESLint flat configuration;
- Prettier;
- TypeScript project references;
- Husky is intentionally omitted; CI is authoritative and optional local Git hooks can be documented without becoming a required dependency;
- Changesets is omitted until packages are published;
- Turborepo or Nx is omitted; pnpm workspaces and TypeScript references are enough at this scale.

## 14. TypeScript configuration

Base requirements:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2023",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "skipLibCheck": false
  }
}
```

Web configuration may use `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` as required by Vite, but shared/backend packages use NodeNext. Every package has its own `tsconfig.json` extending the base.

## 15. CI and security tooling

GitHub Actions must run:

1. frozen dependency install;
2. formatting check;
3. zero-warning lint;
4. strict type checking;
5. unit and integration tests;
6. coverage;
7. production builds;
8. PostgreSQL migrations against an empty test database;
9. Playwright critical flows;
10. CDK tests and synthesis;
11. CodeQL;
12. GitHub dependency review;
13. `pnpm audit --prod`;
14. Gitleaks secret scan;
15. CycloneDX SBOM generation;
16. artifact upload for test results and SBOM.

Deployment uses GitHub OIDC to assume an AWS role restricted by repository, branch and environment. No AWS access key is stored in GitHub.

## 16. Scaling path

### Stage A: simulation MVP

- Lambda/API Gateway;
- Neon free PostgreSQL;
- one scheduled job;
- static assumptions;
- no provider credentials.

### Stage B: public portfolio release

- paid Neon tier if required;
- WAF;
- stronger alarms and backups;
- custom domain;
- penetration testing appropriate to public exposure.

### Stage C: provider sandbox

- provider adapters;
- webhook inbox;
- transactional outbox;
- provider operation records;
- reconciliation;
- SQS FIFO for financial commands;
- legal and vendor review.

### Stage D: live financial beta

- selected sponsor-bank or custodian program;
- production KYC and funding;
- paid database with verified recovery objectives;
- WAF and threat monitoring;
- independent security validation;
- human operational review;
- compliance-approved language and procedures.

### Stage E: sustained scale

Move API or workers to ECS only when measured evidence supports it. Migrate PostgreSQL to RDS/Aurora only when contracts, networking, workload, recovery, or cost justify it. Domain, contracts and repositories remain unchanged.

## 17. Version update policy

- Exact direct versions are committed.
- Dependabot may open patch and minor updates weekly.
- No automatic merge for production dependencies.
- Every update runs the complete compatibility suite.
- Major upgrades require an ADR and migration notes.
- Security fixes take priority over version freeze.
- `STACK.md` and the lockfile must agree.
- Codex must never replace a library because it prefers a different tool without explicit approval.

## 18. Final stack rationale

This stack demonstrates:

- a polished React and TypeScript application;
- a production-structured Node/Fastify backend;
- PostgreSQL schema design and migrations;
- deterministic financial-domain engineering;
- authentication and tenant isolation;
- serverless AWS architecture;
- infrastructure as code;
- scheduled cloud processing;
- observability, CI/CD and security controls;
- a provider-adapter path to the long-term product.

It avoids paying for mature-platform infrastructure before GoalPilot proves that users value the simulated set-and-forget goal experience.
